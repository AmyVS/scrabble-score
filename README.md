# Scrabble Score

Here's how it works: the user enters a word (no symbols, numbers, or spaces please... and, alas, the program isn't smart enough to know whether or not the word you enter is a Scrabble acceptable word...) and once "Get Score!" is clicked, Scrabble Score will reveal the user's total points for that word! Sorry, it doesn't take into account "double word scores", adding onto already existing words on the board, and the like - perhaps I will include that in Scrabble Score 2, if I get around to it. ;)
